                <p>The planned start date overlaps with existing training for the same apprentice. This may be because the previous employer:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>has not yet stopped the apprenticeship</li>
                  <li>has stopped the record with an incorrect date</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Before you can add this apprentice, you need to confirm the stop date with the previous employer.</p>

                <p>To request that the previous employer updates their records you can:</p>
                             
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">
                  <li>send an email from the service</li>
